Grahams Dotfiles

# THE BELOW IS INVALID - THIS IS A TEST FILE - PLEASE DO NOT CLONE

Dotfiles for Vim and ZSH (and script homebrew environment setup).

Collected approach from various sources. Thanks to Nelstrom, Jack Franklin and Thoughtbot.

Files are symlinked into proper location, and have the `.` added. For example:

```
~/dotfiles/vim/vim => ~/.vim
~/dotfiles/vim/vimrc => ~/.vimrc
~/dotfiles/zsh/zshrc => ~/.zshrc
~/dotfiles/git/gitignore_global => ~/.gitignore_global
...and so on
```
# Installing
<!---
- Swap shell to ZSH (System Prefs -> Users -> Right Click on 'Advanced Settings' -> select ZSH from dropdown).
- Clone repo (recommend `~/dotfiles`). If you don't use `~/dotfiles`, you'll have to update a couple of the scripts to point them to the right place.
- `cd ~/dotfiles`

- Install Node from [NodeJS.org](http://nodejs.org/). (The brew install causes problems with its different paths for node module installs, and it's easier to suck it up and install this way).
- `make`
- That will set up everything, but you'll need to install the Vim plugins. Load up vim (you'll get some errors the first time, ignore them) and run `:BundleInstall`. Once that's done, restart Vim and you're all set to code.


# Adding new vim plugin
- plugins are managed in `vim/vimrc` with [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle). Add a plugin there, restart Vim and run `:BundleInstall`.

# homebrew
- Add line to `Brewfile`.
- Run `make brew`


# node & npm
- Node is installed via the installer on nodejs.org.
- packages are managed in `scripts/npm_bundles.rb`. Add a new package, and run `make node`.

# gems
- Add gem to `scripts/gems.rb`
- `make gems`

# Updating
You can run `make` at any time to keep things nice and tidy.

# Requirements

You'll need Ruby and Git installed initially, to first clone this repo and then to run `./scripts/make.sh` (which in turn calls various Ruby & Sh files. Once that's done, you'll have Ruby properly setup through `rbenv` and the latest Git installed also through homebrew, but you'll need some version of Ruby & Git to get started.

These dotfiles should be fairly agnostic about the OS and environment, but be aware this has only been tested on my machines (Mac, OS X Lion).
